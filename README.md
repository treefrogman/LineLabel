# LineLabel
JavaScript library for adding inline labels to any SVG path. Useful for roadmaps, diagrams, and most especially [Nøde](https://github.com/treefrogman/NodeOpDevEnvironment).

# Constructor

```js
new LineLabel( path, text, layers, [ opts = {
	...
} ] );
```
## Parameters
- `path`  
	The SVG element to which the label shall be shaped.
	
- `text`  
	The text content of the label.
	
- `layers`  
	An array, in stacking order, of layer objects. See below for details.

- `opts`  
	The optional options.

## Layers
```js
layers( [
	{ elem: 'back', css: 'blackLabelBorder' },
	{ elem: 'back', css: 'whiteLabelBack' },
	{ elem: 'text', css: 'blackLabelText' }
] )
```
The `layers` parameter consists of an ordered list of graphical layers to be generated and the CSS class to apply to each.
Each layer object specifies `elem` as either `'text'` or `'back'`, and `css` as a CSS class name to apply to the element. 

## Options
- `trim: [ 0, 0 ]`  
	For the purpose of calculating lengths and positions, pretend the path is longer or shorter on each end. Lengths are in pixels; positive numbers shorten the path.
	
- `flip: 0b00`  
	Flip the text before shaping it to the path. A pair of bits representing horizontal and vertical flip respectively. Margins and baseline shift are flipped as well.
	
- `margins: [ 0, 0 ]`  
	Increase (or decrease) margins on left and right ends of text. Lengths are in pixels; positive numbers lengthen the background.
	
- `yOffset: 0`  
	Adjust the baseline shift / y offset. Positive numbers raise text.

- `spacing: [ min = 0, max = 68 ]`  
	Minimum and maximum spacing for multiple labels along the path. For short paths only a single centered label is drawn, or nothing if the space is too small. If there's room with `min` between, the one label is replaced with a label at each end of the path. When those labels are more than `max` apart, another label is added in between. This patterns goes on, distributing labels along the path so they are never more than `max` apart.

- `single: false`  
	Disable the aforementioned label distribution method, and create a single label instead.

- `align: left | center | right` (only applicable in `single` mode)  
	Align the label on the path. `trim`, `flip`, and `margins` are taken into account in calculating the final placement.

# Methods
#### `path( [ path ] )`
Get or set the SVG element to which the label shall be shaped.

#### `text( [ text ] )`
Get or set the text content of the label.

#### `layers( [ layers ] )`
Get or replace the array of layer objects.

#### `opts( [ opts ] )`
- `opts()`  
	Get the current options. Returns the options object, with an additional property called `defaults`, containing all the default options, and a method `opt( 'optname' )` to get the dominant value for a given option.
- `opts( opts )`  
	Set options. Does not unset any previously set options. To reset an option to default, assign a value of `null` to it in the options object. To reset all, call `opts( null )`.

#### `element()`
Return an SVG group element containing all graphical components.

#### `update()`
Update all graphical components. Should be called manually after making any changes to the label or the path's `d` attribute.


# Roadmap
A good bit of the functionality has [already been implemented in the Nøde codebase](https://github.com/treefrogman/NodeOpDevEnvironment/blob/master/js/connector.js), but needs to be refactored and made more customizable.

The API has been specified, but needs review and possible refinement before moving into development.

After finalizing the API, I would like to write a test suite before diving into the thick of it. I need to research options for graphical testing.
